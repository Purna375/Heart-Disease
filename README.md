# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical attributes. It helps in early diagnosis and assists healthcare professionals in making data-driven decisions.

## 🔍 Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This project aims to build a predictive model using various machine learning algorithms that can help identify whether a patient is likely to develop heart disease.

## 🧠 Features

- Predicts presence of heart disease using patient data
- Supports multiple ML algorithms for benchmarking
- Visualizes key relationships in the dataset
- Evaluates models using classification metrics

## 📚 Technologies Used

- **Python** - Programming Language
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive Coding Environment
- **Pandas** - Data Manipulation
- **NumPy** - Numerical Operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** - Data Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine Learning Algorithms

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset used contains 14 medical attributes such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting ECG results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression
- Slope of peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels
- Thalassemia
- Target (presence of heart disease: 1 = yes, 0 = no)
